# Background

One challenge with the current AOP-Wiki is that it runs on a first-come-first-owned basis. That first author of an entity in the wiki becomes the owner, and must approve any and all changes. So this doesn't quite embrace the open source workflow that works best in the software development world. We want to change this to make it easier for anyone to work with AOPs.

Another challenge is that the AOP-Wiki in the past did not handle ontologies at all. So, new concepts were not aligned with an ontology, which made it difficult to know that one biological entity was the same as another. As a result, people are now going back in and trying to correct the lack of ontologies.

Our solution is to adopt common open source software practices, and be ontology-first. People will create AOPs in a JUPYTER notebook 

The JUPYTER notebook is designed to be uploaded to Google Colab. So Lyle will host it in his google drive as a template. Then others can copy the template and make it their own. 

We will have versions of the notebook for others to use as a guide on Github.

We will also offer training on how to use it.

We will host hackathons.

We will talk about how we envision the project -- so I'll need to do a webinar.

Eventually, we will need to write code to hook all of the AOPs together and put them into a cloud-hosted Neo4J graph database. Then we will start hooking those up with commercially available assays.

We will also need a web-based GUI that people can run to overlay their data onto the AOPs, or onto the AOP network. 

Ultimately I will want to be able to come up with a batter of in vitro assays that covers a large swath of space.

Commercial vendors can pay to advertise in the system to have their assays listed at the top of our results.
